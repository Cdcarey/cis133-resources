#Cis133-resources

1. <strong>https://digital.com/tools/html-cheatsheet/</strong> 
    * This resource calls itself a 'cheat sheet' and lists current elements of HTML5. It is very interactive, and it provides a brief description of what the element means an how it works. What I like the most about it is that it actually provides a preview, so that you can visually see how the element is structured.

2. <strong>https://flexboxfroggy.com/</strong>
    * This CSS resource presents CSS properties via a simple game. It provides succint descriptions, and lets you practice each property visually - both in code and image. I found this resource to be helpful, as I learn best by doing.
